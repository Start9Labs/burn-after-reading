# Burn After Reading (BAR)

## Config
If you choose to change your random, default BAR password, we recommend using an equally complex password and relying on your Vaultwarden Server to to save it.

**Note**: You can change your password at any time by visiting the BAR Config in your Embassy app.

## Browsers
1. Copy/paste your BAR Tor address into any Tor-enabled browser. Options include:
   * Onion Browser (iOS)
   * Tor Browser (desktop, android)
   * Firefox with SOCKS5 proxy enabled (desktop, android)
   * Brave with SOCKS5 proxy enabled (desktop)
2. Log in using your BAR password, located in the "Properties" section of your StartOS BAR service.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
